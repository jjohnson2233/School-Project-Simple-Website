            <h1>Where should I move?</h1>

            <p>Hello and welcome! In these next couple of years I'm planning to move to the beautiful state of California. This site is made to compare and contrast the different parts of the area, and see where I might want to live. There's a ton of different cities to chose from; It's a big state! I was able to narrow down to three - Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose - so those are what I'm going to be covering.</p>

            <h2>Where I live now and why I'm moving</h2>

            <p>Right now I live in Seattle Washington, and I've been doing so for almost 13 years now. The Seattle area is not a bad place to live by any means. The trees and mountains that surround the city are breathtaking, and the city itself has a modern and metropolitan look to it, but there's just one problem.... I can't stand the weather.</p>

            <p>As you might already know, Seattle has a reputation of always being cloudy and rainy. While there are a few exceptions, it's pretty much true. I never used to mind this growing up, but lately it's been really affecting my mood. The lack of sun for most of the year put's a grey filter on everything, and you almost always have to carry a jacket with you wherever you go.</p>

            <p>I've always been drawn to California, but it's been especially difficult for me to move due to the following reasons:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Not enough money</li>
                <li>Not enough job experience</li>
                <li>Tied down by school</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>But now that I have a good amount of money saved up, I'm doing online school, and I have about 1 1/2 years of  job experience, it's time to make the move!</p>
